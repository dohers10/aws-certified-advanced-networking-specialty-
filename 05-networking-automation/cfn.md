## General
    - 500 resources per stack
    - resources in a single stack share a lifecyle together ( delete all)
    - stacks isolated by default
    - 

## Nested stacks
    - Root stack - stack created first
    - Parent stack - parent of any stacks it creates
    - whole templates used in other stacks
    - good for if you have resource limits
    - can reuse code multiple times
    - Use only when everything is lifecycle linked - all or nothing together!

## Cross-stack references
    - uses exports which makes them visibile from other stacks
    - exports must have a unique name in the region
    - cross region or cross account NOT supported.
    - service orientated acrhictectures or short-lives services ( diff lifecycles etc)
